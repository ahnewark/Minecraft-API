<h1>MineOnline Launcher</h1>
This API was developed with and for the MineOnline Launcher for playing pre-release versions of Minecraft.<br/>
This launcher allows players to play early web applet versions of the game without a browser, and restores authentication, online saving, and other features, with no .jar modifications.<br/>
